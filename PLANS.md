  - [ ] Test route discovery
  - [ ] Test file creation
  - [ ] Basic integration test

---

## 🔧 Simplified Approach

### Core Dependencies Only
- **Essential:** `puppeteer`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- **Development:** `typescript`, `@types/node`
- **Quality:** `eslint`, `prettier` (minimal configs)

### Key Simplifications
1. **No complex CLI library** - Use simple argument parsing
2. **No advanced configuration** - Single config file, sensible defaults
3. **No complex routing** - Just scan pages directory
4. **No authentication** - Keep it simple, unauthenticated only
5. **No visual diffing** - Just capture and store
6. **No cloud integration** - Local storage only
7. **No fancy progress bars** - Simple console logging

### Minimal File Structure
```

│   ├── capture.ts       # Screenshot logic
│   ├── discovery.ts     # Route finding
│   ├── storage.ts       # File management
